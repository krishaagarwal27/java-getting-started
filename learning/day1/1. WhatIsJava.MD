##What ia Java?

**Java** is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** that is widely used for building software applications. It was created by **James Gosling** and his team at **Sun Microsystems** in **1995** (now owned by **Oracle Corporation**).

Here’s a quick breakdown of what Java is and why it’s important 👇

### 🧠 **Key Concepts**

* **Object-Oriented:** Java is based on objects and classes, which helps in organizing code and reusing it easily.
* **Platform-Independent:** Java programs are compiled into **bytecode**, which runs on the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**. This means the same code can run on any device that has a JVM — the concept of **“Write Once, Run Anywhere.”**
* **Strongly Typed:** Variables must have a declared type, which makes programs less error-prone.
* **Automatic Memory Management:** Java has a **garbage collector** that automatically frees up memory that’s no longer in use.

### ⚙️ **How Java Works**

1. You write code in a `.java` file.
2. The Java **compiler** (`javac`) converts it into **bytecode** (`.class` file).
3. The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** executes this bytecode on any platform.

### 💡 **Common Uses of Java**

* **Web applications** (using frameworks like Spring or Jakarta EE)
* **Mobile apps** (especially Android)
* **Enterprise systems**
* **Desktop software**
* **Cloud-based services**
* **Games and scientific applications**

### 📘 **Super Simple Java Application Code**

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

This simple program prints “Hello, World!” to the console.
Real world application will have multiple java files and collection of this java classes help make one application
