**Java libraries** are **collections of prewritten code** that you can use to perform some things — instead of writing everything from scratch.

Think of a library as a **friend** who helps you do something which he knows best.

### 🧠 **In Simple Terms**

A **Java library** is a **set of classes, interfaces, and methods** that you can import into your program to use specific features.

Example:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;  // Importing a class from a Java library ie. asking a friend to come for help

public class InputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Here we are telling the friend to get ready
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);  
        
        System.out.println("Enter your name: ");
        
        // Here we are telling the friend to get ready
        String name = sc.nextLine(); // Here we are telling the friend to help with some action 
        
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
    }
}
```

Here, `java.util.Scanner` is part of the **Java Standard Library**, and it helps you take user input.

### 🏛️ **Types of Java Libraries**

#### 1. **Standard Libraries (Built-in)**

These come with Java automatically (in the **Java Development Kit – JDK**).
Some popular packages include:

| Package                    | Purpose                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `java.lang`                | Basic language features (Math, String, Object, etc.)      |
| `java.util`                | Utilities like collections, date/time, and random numbers |
| `java.io`                  | Input and output (reading/writing files)                  |
| `java.net`                 | Networking (handling URLs, sockets)                       |
| `java.sql`                 | Database access (JDBC)                                    |
| `java.awt` / `javax.swing` | Building GUI (Graphical User Interface) apps              |

#### 2. **External (Third-Party) Libraries**

These are created by developers or organizations outside of Oracle.
You can add them to your project to extend Java’s capabilities.

✅ **Examples:**

* **Apache Commons** → Common utilities (string handling, file operations)
* **Google Guava** → Collections, caching, concurrency helpers
* **JUnit** → For testing Java programs
* **Jackson / Gson** → For working with JSON data
* **Spring Framework** → For enterprise and web applications
* **Hibernate** → For database management (ORM)

### ⚙️ **How to Use a Library**

You can add libraries in several ways:

* By importing `.jar` (Java Archive) files into your project
* Using **build tools** like **Maven** or **Gradle**, which automatically download and manage libraries for you
